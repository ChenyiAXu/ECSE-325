#### Implementation of 5 order polynomial approximation to sin(x) with/without pipeline
- Pipeline : insert registers at every operation to balance the pathway

### Lab 4 Final Implementation
- Tools -> Qsys -> System Contents Pane appear
- Under `Library` -> Processors and Peripherals -> Hard Process Systems -> Arria V/Cyclone V Hard Processor System
- Under `Library` -> Basic Functions -> On Chip Memory -> On chip memory (RAM or ROM)
- Under `Library` -> Processors and Peripherals -? PIO (Parallel I/O)
