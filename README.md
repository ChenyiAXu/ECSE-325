## SHA256 System
### Lab 2 -- descirbe and simulate the building blocks for the system
- Implementation of Sig_Maj_Ch block

### Lab 3 
#### Hash Core Logic
- Implementation of Hash Core Logic
- Timing analyses at different clock frequencies

#### Implementation of 5 order polynomial approximation to sin(x) with/without pipeline
- Pipeline : insert registers at every operation to balance the pathway

### Lab 4 Final Implementation
4 main tasks 
- Design of the message schedule circuit
- design Avalon Salve Interface
- USe Platform designer to create the complete system and connect to the HPS Arm CPU
- Simulation of a single message block
#### Start Platform Designer
- Navigate to **`Tools` -> `Qsys` -> `System Contents Pane`**.
- `Tools`-> `options` -> add project directory to IP search path
#### Add Components
- **Processors and Peripherals**:
  - Go to **`Library` -> `Processors and Peripherals` -> `Hard Processor Systems`**.
  - Select **`Arria V/Cyclone V Hard Processor System`** -> add.
  - select **`Altera_Cyclone_V_SOC_Development_Kit_HPS_Presets`** -> click `Finsih`
- **PIO (Parallel I/O)**:
  - Go to **`Library` -> `Processors and Peripherals` -> `PIO (Parallel I/O)`**.
  - Add the required **PIO components**.
        - LeDS: Bit-width 10, output, rename to LEDS
        - HEX3-HEX0: Bit-width 32, output, rename to HEX3-HEX0
        - HEX5-HEX4: Bit-width 16, output, rename to HEX5-HEX4
        - Switches: bit-width 10, input, rename to switches
        - Pushbuttons: Bit-width 4, input, check `Synchronous Capture`, set `Falling` Edge type, check `Generate IRQ`, set IRQ type to EDGE, rename to pushbuttons

#### connect Components
- **Clock and Reset Signals**:
  - Connect all components' clock signals to the **`clk`** of clk_0 component.
  - connect all components' reset signals to the  **`clk_reset`** signal
  - Perform the same with h2f_reset_output
- **PIO Connections**:
  - Connect irq signal of Pushbuttons to f3h_irq0 of hps_0 component (interruppt receiver) 
  - Connect **`s1`** under all components to **`h2f_lw_axi_master`** (Light Weight HPS to FPGA) on the hps_0 component.
  - under export column, external connection section -> name these rled, switch, hex3_hex0, hex5_hex4, and pushbuttons respectively
  - change pushbuttons IRQ to `1`
  - System-> Assign Base Address
#### Export the Design
  -   `Generate HDL` -> `Generate HDL Design Files for synthesis ` ->  `VHDL' -> uncheck  `create timing ` -> select  `None` for create smulation modle -> Generate
  - Back to Quartus: project -> add/remove Files in projects -> add the *.qip file in the directory
  - set the VHD file generated by platform designer as top level entity
  - run analysis the synthesis
  - Tools -> TCL script to perform pin assignments for the memory connected to HPS
  - Assignments -> Import Assignments -> Choose the file qsys_tutorial.qsf to load pre-defined assignments
  - recompile the design
  - add a new custom component 

#### Custom Component

 Create the VHDL code for the component then opem platform designer
   - IP -> New component -> Add
   - Files -> select created VHDL file -> Analyze Synthesis Files
   -  Signlas & Interfaces -> uner clock1 signal click `add interface`
   -  select `new Clock input` -> change to clock_sink
   -  move clock1 signal to clock_sink interface, change signal type to clk
   -  move resetn signal to be under clock_reset, change signal type to reset_n
   -  avlon_slave_0 -> associated clock -> clock_sink
   -  clock_reset -> associated clock -> clock_sink
   -  save
   -  add the component as before, perform same connections as pushbuttons
   -  redo the address change command
   -  rerun the generate HDL in platform designer
